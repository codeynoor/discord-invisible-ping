# 🕵️ Discord invisible ping

Sends a message to discord containing an invisible or hidden ping. 🕵️
This started as a simple idea for me to get back in touch with python, it's not the best, but it's usable. 

# ⚙️ Installation
1. Make sure you have the required modules installed.
2. Get the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/codeynoor/discord-invisible-ping/releases/tag/v1.0.0) page.

# ❓ How to use
Just run it.
